\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}
The development of a web app front-end involves multiple stakeholders, chief among them the graphics designer and web developer. A UI mockup designed by the graphics designer has to be analyzed and processed by a web developer in order create the app's front-end code, a task that is laborious and involves manual time consuming steps. In this chapter, we proposed an approach to automate this aspect of web development by generating reusable web components from a mockup. We conducted an evaluation on real-world web mockups and assessed the quality of generated components through comparison with expert developers. An average of \precision precision and \recall recall was achieved in terms of agreement with the developers' assessment, the refactorings were performed in a correct manner, and the components achieved a 22\% reusability, on average.
