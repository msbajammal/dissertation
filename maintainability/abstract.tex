The transformation of a user interface mockup designed by a graphic designer 
to web components in the final app built by a web developer is often laborious,
involving manual and time consuming steps.
We propose an approach to automate this aspect of web development by generating reusable web components from a mockup. Our approach employs visual analysis of the mockup, and unsupervised learning of visual cues to create reusable web components (e.g., \react components).
We evaluated our approach, implemented in a tool called \toolname, on five 
real-world web mockups, and assessed the transformations and generated components through comparison with web development experts. 
The results show that \toolname achieves on average \precision precision and \recall recall in terms of agreement with the developers' assessment. 
Furthermore, the refactorings yielded 22\% code reusability, on average.
