\chapter{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I wish to express my deepest gratitude 
to my supervisor, Prof. Ali Mesbah. His guidance and expertise 
were instrumental throughout the entire duration of my 
doctoral studies, and his insight and support has made the work in this 
dissertation possible. My sincere gratitude also goes to my  committee members, Prof. Julia Rubin, Prof. Sathish Gopalakrishnan, and Prof. Philippe Kruchten. 

I would also like to thank all my dear friends and colleagues in our research lab, 
Amir, Andrea, Davood, Mifta, Marjana, Nashid, Quinn, Rahul, Saba, and Sijia for 
our lively discussions.  
To my parents, Faiga and Salem, I am eternally grateful for your endless 
love, understanding, and support throughout the years.
