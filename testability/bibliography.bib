	abstract = {Automated UI testing suffers from fragility due to continuous -although minor- changes in the UI of applications. Such fragility has been shown especially for the web domain, though no clear evidence is available for mobile applications. Our goal is to perform an exploratory assessment of the extent and causes of the fragiliy of UI automated tests for mobile applications. For this purpose, we analyzed a small test suite -that we developed using five different testing frameworks for an Android application (K-9 Mail) and observed the changes induced in the tests by the evolution of the UI. We found that up to 75\% of code-based tests, and up to 100\% of image recognition tests, had to be adapted because of the changes induced by the evolution of the application between two different versions. In addition we identified the main causes of such fragility: changes of identifiers, text or graphics, removal or relocation of elements, activity flow variation, execution time variation, and usage of physical buttons. The preliminary assessment showed that the fragility of UI tests can be a relevant issue also for mobile applications. A few common causes were found that can be used as the basis for providing guidelines for fragility avoidance and repair.},

	abstract = {Automation in Web testing has been successfully supported by DOM-based tools that allow testers to program the interactions of their test cases with the Web application under test. More recently a new generation of visual tools has been proposed where a test case interacts with the Web application by recognising the images of the widgets that can be actioned upon and by asserting the expected visual appearance of the result.In this paper, we first discuss the inherent robustness of the locators created by following the visual and DOM-based approaches and we then compare empirically a visual and a DOM-based tool, taking into account both the cost for initial test suite development from scratch and the cost for test suite maintenance during code evolution. Since visual tools are known to be computationally demanding, we also measure the test suite execution time.Results indicate that DOM-based locators are generally more robust than visual ones and that DOM-based test cases can be developed from scratch and evolved at lower cost. Moreover, DOM-based test cases require a lower execution time. However, depending on the specific features of the Web application under test and its expected evolution, in some cases visual locators might be the best choice (e.g., when the visual appearance is more stable than the structure).},
