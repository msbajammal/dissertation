\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}

Web applications are typically composed of two main parts:
the front-end and the back-end. 
The front-end encapsulates all the user facing
elements of the application.
It includes aspects such as the user interface (UI) layout,
design themes and styles, and handling user interaction.
The back-end contains the remainder of the application
and includes functionalities such as database access and
server setup and operation.

The development of front-end or UI for web apps
is often a manual and time consuming task.
In a survey of more than 5,700 web app developers,
51\% reported working on front-end development tasks on a
daily basis~\cite{IDC:survey}, more so than all
other development tasks (e.g., databases, back-end integration).
Another study also showed that an average of
48\% of the code size of software
is dedicated to the user interface~\cite{myers:ui:survey}. 
Accordingly, there is a need to reduce the manual effort and time 
spent on the development, testing, and analysis of UI. 
 
UIs can have both \emph{functional} and \emph{non-functional} properties or requirements. 
Non-functional properties are generic and qualitative aspects of the software~\cite{behutiye2017non,chung2012non}, 
whereas the functional properties or requirements capture specific and precise behavior. 
Non-functional properties describe general high-level qualities of the software that do not depend on a single specific function or element of the software, whereas the functional requirements or properties 
are fine-grained and exact. For instance, a functional requirement would describe what should happen exactly when a \emph{specific} button on the UI is pressed, thereby defining the function of that particular button.  In contrast, a non-functional property such as accessibility applies to the UI in general, such as requiring that any part of the UI is coded using markup that expresses its high-level purpose (e.g., navigation areas, menus) whenever meaningful. These are different from the functional requirements which specify, for instance, that clicking a specific button \emph{x} shows a menu \emph{y}. The non-functional properties are therefore more qualitative and high-level compared to the more precise and exact functional ones. 
 
Most areas of the software engineering lifecycle (e.g., requirements, 
development, testing) often have the ultimate goal of contributing to a
fundamental product of software engineering: the source code.
Accordingly, a wide range of software research and development activities have
typically revolved around the source code,
whether to improve its quality and reliability, or increase 
developers' productivity. As such, most existing techniques that analyze 
or test web UI tend to be code-based analyses, which focus on examining 
the source code of the app. 

A scarcely explored, and potentially useful, recent alternative paradigm 
is the adoption of what might be referred to as a \emph{visual analysis} 
approach to software engineering~\cite{bajammal2020survey}. 
This approach involves the use of algorithms 
that extract or analyze any visual aspect pertaining to the software. 
The objective is to address software engineering tasks or problems 
by utilizing a complementary (i.e., visual) perspective of the software 
instead of relying exclusively on the code. 
For instance, a typical visual analysis approach 
might involve visually comparing a pair of screenshot images of different 
versions of a software's UI for testing purposes, such as testing for regressions or for cross-browser incompatibilities. 
In \autoref{chp:survey}, we conduct an in-depth investigation in terms of exploring and classifying visual analysis techniques and how they are used. 
 
  
\section{Challenges and Motivation}  
The goal of this dissertation is to investigate how visual approaches can automate 
the analysis and testing of non-functional web UI properties. 
Non-functional properties have received less research attention compared to functional ones~\cite{jha2019mining,behutiye2017non}.
The qualitative nature of non-functional properties makes them harder to precisely analyze and test. 
Their qualitative nature has also limited the extent to which they can be properly automated since many aspects often require 
a high-level qualitative judgment by a human observer~\cite{acosta2018toward,bai2016evaluation}. 
For instance, accessibility is a non-functional property or requirement that expects 
a web UI to be implemented using markup code that reflects its \emph{intended purpose}~\cite{ARIA}. 
That is, if some portion or region of web UI is meant to be the main section of the page  as opposed to being, for instance, a navigation region or footer of the page, then the code of the UI must reflect that specific intended purpose. Inference and understanding of the possible intended purposes within a UI requires a qualitative and semantic judgment that no existing approaches address~\cite{bajammal2021semantic,ukgov:audit:2018}.
Accordingly, the testing and analysis of non-functional properties has typically remained 
a manual and laborious time consuming process. 

In this dissertation, we focus on the particular problems of the non-functional properties of 
testability, accessibility, and maintainability 
because they have not been amenable to automation so far, as will be discussed in the next sections.  
In addition, these properties also sample various stages of the software engineering lifecycle (i.e., development, testing, maintenance). 
Given that web UI is visual in nature, we believe that it would be 
a suitable fit to use a visual analysis approach to analyze various aspects 
of web UI. This can be especially advantageous in advancing the state-of-the-art 
of analyzing non-functional UI properties due to their high-level qualitative nature. 
In other words, as will be demonstrated in the following subsections, a visual analysis approach might be able to capture and imitate some of the 
high-level visual understanding that is currently being done manually by developers, and therefore might be able to automate more tasks. 
We therefore begin by thoroughly and systematically understanding how visual analysis has been used so far in various areas of software engineering. 


\ \\ 
\textbf{Research Question A.}
\textit{What areas of software engineering have benefited from visual analysis 
	and how?}
\\ 
We tackle this RQ by conducting a systematic survey to help structure, 
curate, and unify the dispersed literature in this research area,
and to understand how visual analysis approaches have
been used in software engineering, what areas have benefited from visual 
analysis and their rationale for adoption, 
and what are the challenges reported when they were used. 
This would help shed light on the potential of these 
techniques, and make them more visible and accessible. 
\autoref{chp:survey} is dedicated to this RQ. 
 
\subsection{Testability}\label{subsec:testability}
Testability refers to the extent to which a software, or a portion of it,
is amenable to having its functionality tested~\cite{garousi2019survey, 
rodriguez2014general}. 
A non-testable software would therefore have no mechanism by which any form 
of test specification can be defined and executed. 
In contrast, a fully-testable software has the capacity to have all of its 
functions tested in every aspect.   

One of the least testable aspects in web UI are \emph{canvas elements}
~\cite{w3c_canvas_standard}. These elements enable interactive and rich 
web graphics, visualizations, and charts. However, existing web testing technologies do not apply to these elements, 
thereby rendering them untestable. The reason behind this is that the state of 
canvas elements is not \emph{observable}~\cite{w3c_canvas_standard}, by design, 
from a code-based perspective. 
That is, the canvas HTML element is just an empty placeholder that does 
not contain any information about the canvas, and therefore the canvas state 
is only \emph{visually} observable by developers. 
The lack of observability has been also shown~\cite{garousi2019survey} to be 
one of the main factors affecting software testability in general. 

\ \\ 
\textbf{Research Question B.}
\textit{How can we make untestable web UI canvas elements testable through visual 
	analysis?
}
\\ 
\autoref{chp:testability} is dedicated to investigating this RQ, where we propose 
a technique that visually analyzes the rendered web canvas elements and infers their 
states. The state describes the visual content of the canvas, their properties, 
and arrangement. This state is then synthesized and augmented into the DOM of the canvas element, 
thereby making it testable by existing web testing technologies (e.g., 
Selenium). 
 

\subsection{Accessibility} \label{subsec:accessibility}
An accessible UI is one that allows users with disabilities, often visual disability~\cite{2019users_survey},   
to easily use the various functionalities in the app. An inaccessible UI, on the other 
hand, can only be used by sighted users. 
Millions of people around the world are impacted by the lack of software 
accessibility~\cite{stats:accessibility_population:US}.
Furthermore, many jurisdictions around the world are increasingly ratifying legal 
requirements for software to be accessible~\cite{law:ada, law:eu_accessibility}.   

Testing a web UI's accessibility requires ensuring that  
any information expressed through the visual structure and content of the UI has 
also been explicitly declared in the UI's markup. A number of tools  
exist for performing elementary \emph{syntax} checks~\cite{ukgov:audit:2018}. 
These checks provide quick and simple tests that, for instance, checks that no 
hyperlink elements are empty. They do not, due to their limited syntactic nature, 
test for the essential aspects of accessibility that require a \emph{semantic} 
understanding the content and structure of the UI. 
There has been little to no research on automating the testing of 
these key qualitative and semantic aspects of accessibility, 
such as declaration of the high-level purpose of UI regions (e.g., navigation areas, menus), or 
specification of accessible form labeling, as will be discussed in \Cref{chp:accessibility_repair}. 
Therefore, the standard practice is based on the laborious time-consuming task 
of manually checking the UI for accessibility~\cite{acosta:toward, bai:evaluation}.

\ \\ 
\textbf{Research Question C.}
\textit{How can we visually test the semantic accessibility of web UIs?}
\\ 
In \autoref{chp:accessibility_testing}, we address this RQ and propose 
a technique that performs a visual inference process to determine the 
semantic role of various regions in the UI. The markup of the UI is then 
tested to ensure that the visually inferred roles have been equivalently 
expressed in the markup. 

Next, we explore another accessibility research problem related to web forms. 
It has been shown that missing \emph{form labeling} is one of the three most 
common web accessibility issues~\cite{webaim1mil}.
Web form labeling accessibility requires explicitly declaring the 
labels of all fields, in order to allow non-sighted users 
to access that information. Accordingly, if a non-sighted user reaches a form 
that has no accessibility labeling, they currently have little to no available 
options in terms of automatically repairing the form labeling in order to be able 
to access that form. This, of course, can be a significant obstacle because web forms 
are ubiquitous. 

\ \\ 
\textbf{Research Question D.}
\textit{Can we automatically repair the accessibility of web UI forms through 
	visual analysis?}
\\ 
\autoref{chp:accessibility_repair} explores this RQ. We propose a technique 
that abstracts web forms and builds a collection of visual cues for all form 
fields. An optimization problem is then formulated that infers the labeling 
associations for all fields. Finally, the inferred associations are augmented 
in the form's markup to ensure that the labeling is accessible. 

\subsection{Maintainability} \label{subsec:maintainability}
Maintainability is defined as the degree to which software can be modified by its maintainers~\cite{iso25010, ebeling2019introduction}. 
It reflects the ease with which software can be modified, comprehended, or reused. 
Software has poor maintainability if it takes a lot of effort and time for developers to 
modify it in response to changes (e.g., changing requirements, environments). When structured using best practices~\cite{hegedHus2018empirical,frantz2019ranking} (e.g., modularity, refactoring), 
software becomes more maintainable.
 
For web UI, creating \emph{components} is a common approach  
that has been used in practice to improve maintainability~\cite{StateOfJS:WebPlatformTests}. 
A component is a piece of code that captures common or repetitive features 
in a UI, such that the component can be easily instantiated or replicated wherever 
needed~\cite{Angular_components}. 
However, creating components is often time consuming and tedious~\cite{thinking:in:components}; 
it requires several manual steps, including the examination of a UI mockup, 
checking potential elements that may or may not be suitable for conversion to 
components, constructing a template for components that unifies repeated segments,
adding placeholders for variable content, and refactoring the code
to replace instances with instantiated components. 
   
\ \\ 
\textbf{Research Question E.}
\textit{How can we generate reusable web UI components through visual analysis?
}
\\ 
\autoref{chp:maintainability} is dedicated to investigating this RQ. We propose 
a technique that visually analyzes common patterns in UI mockups. It then identifies 
how to group such repetitions into components. Finally, reusable UI components are 
generated and refactored into the page using common UI frameworks 
(e.g., React, Angular).

%This document provides a quick set of instructions for using the
%\class{ubcdiss} class to write a dissertation in \LaTeX. 
%Unfortunately this document cannot provide an introduction to using
%\LaTeX.  The classic reference for learning \LaTeX\ is
%\citeauthor{lamport-1994-ladps}'s
%book~\cite{lamport-1994-ladps}.  There are also many freely-available
%tutorials online;
%\webref{http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/}{Andy Roberts' online
%    \LaTeX\ tutorials}
%seems to be excellent.
%The source code for this docment, however, is intended to serve as
%an example for creating a \LaTeX\ version of your dissertation.
%
%We start by discussing organizational issues, such as splitting
%your dissertation into multiple files, in
%\autoref{sec:SuggestedThesisOrganization}.
%We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\ in
%\autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
%We cover managing and using bibliographies with \BibTeX\ in
%\autoref{sec:BibTeX}. 
%We briefly describe typesetting attractive tables in
%\autoref{sec:TypesettingTables}.
%We briefly describe including external figures in
%\autoref{sec:Graphics}, and using special characters and symbols
%in \autoref{sec:SpecialSymbols}.
%As it is often useful to track different versions of your dissertation,
%we discuss revision control further in
%\autoref{sec:DissertationRevisionControl}. 
%We conclude with pointers to additional sources of information in
%\autoref{sec:Conclusions}.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Suggested Thesis Organization}
%\label{sec:SuggestedThesisOrganization}
%
%The \acs{UBC} \acf{GPS} specifies a particular arrangement of the
%components forming a thesis.\footnote{See
%    \url{http://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation/order-components}}
%This template reflects that arrangement.
%
%In terms of writing your thesis, the recommended best practice for
%organizing large documents in \LaTeX\ is to place each chapter in
%a separate file.  These chapters are then included from the main
%file through the use of \verb+\include{file}+.  A thesis might
%be described as six files such as \file{intro.tex},
%\file{relwork.tex}, \file{model.tex}, \file{eval.tex},
%\file{discuss.tex}, and \file{concl.tex}.
%
%We also encourage you to use macros for separating how something
%will be typeset (\eg bold, or italics) from the meaning of that
%something. 
%For example, if you look at \file{intro.tex}, you will see repeated
%uses of a macro \verb+\file{}+ to indicate file names.
%The \verb+\file{}+ macro is defined in the file \file{macros.tex}.
%The consistent use of \verb+\file{}+ throughout the text not only
%indicates that the argument to the macro represents a file (providing
%meaning or semantics), but also allows easily changing how
%file names are typeset simply by changing the definition of the
%\verb+\file{}+ macro.
%\file{macros.tex} contains other useful macros for properly typesetting
%things like the proper uses of the latinate \emph{exempli grati\={a}}
%and \emph{id est} (\ie \verb+\eg+ and \verb+\ie+), 
%web references with a footnoted \acs{URL} (\verb+\webref{url}{text}+),
%as well as definitions specific to this documentation
%(\verb+\latexpackage{}+).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Making Cross-References}
%\label{sec:CrossReferences}
%
%\LaTeX\ make managing cross-references easy, and the \latexpackage{hyperref}
%package's\ \verb+\autoref{}+ command\footnote{%
%    The \latexpackage{hyperref} package is included by default in this
%    template.}
%makes it easier still. 
%
%A thing to be cross-referenced, such as a section, figure, or equation,
%is \emph{labelled} using a unique, user-provided identifier, defined
%using the \verb+\label{}+ command.  
%The thing is referenced elsewhere using the \verb+\autoref{}+ command.
%For example, this section was defined using:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \section{Making Cross-References}
%    \label{sec:CrossReferences}
%\end{lstlisting}
%References to this section are made as follows:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\
%    in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
%\end{lstlisting}
%\verb+\autoref{}+ takes care of determining the \emph{type} of the 
%thing being referenced, so the example above is rendered as
%\begin{quote}
%    We then cover the ease of managing cross-references in \LaTeX\
%    in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.
%\end{quote}
%
%The label is any simple sequence of characters, numbers, digits,
%and some punctuation marks such as ``:'' and ``--''; there should
%be no spaces.  Try to use a consistent key format: this simplifies
%remembering how to make references.  This document uses a prefix
%to indicate the type of the thing being referenced, such as \texttt{sec}
%for sections, \texttt{fig} for figures, \texttt{tbl} for tables,
%and \texttt{eqn} for equations.
%
%For details on defining the text used to describe the type
%of \emph{thing}, search \file{diss.tex} and the \latexpackage{hyperref}
%documentation for \texttt{autorefname}.
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Managing Bibliographies with \BibTeX}
%\label{sec:BibTeX}
%
%One of the primary benefits of using \LaTeX\ is its companion program,
%\BibTeX, for managing bibliographies and citations.  Managing
%bibliographies has three parts: (i) describing references,
%(ii)~citing references, and (iii)~formatting cited references.
%
%\subsection{Describing References}
%
%\BibTeX\ defines a standard format for recording details about a
%reference.  These references are recorded in a file with a
%\file{.bib} extension.  \BibTeX\ supports a broad range of
%references, such as books, articles, items in a conference proceedings,
%chapters, technical reports, manuals, dissertations, and unpublished
%manuscripts. 
%A reference may include attributes such as the authors,
%the title, the page numbers, the \ac{DOI}, or a \ac{URL}.  A reference
%can also be augmented with personal attributes, such as a rating,
%notes, or keywords.
%
%Each reference must be described by a unique \emph{key}.\footnote{%
%    Note that the citation keys are different from the reference
%    identifiers as described in \autoref{sec:CrossReferences}.}
%A key is a simple sequence of characters, numbers, digits, and some
%punctuation marks such as ``:'' and ``--''; there should be no spaces. 
%A consistent key format simiplifies remembering how to make references. 
%For example:
%\begin{quote}
%   \fbox{\emph{last-name}}\texttt{-}\fbox{\emph{year}}\texttt{-}\fbox{\emph{contracted-title}}
%\end{quote}
%where \emph{last-name} represents the last name for the first author,
%and \emph{contracted-title} is some meaningful contraction of the
%title.  Then \citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop}'s seminal article on
%aspect-oriented programming~\cite{kiczales-1997-aop} (published in
%\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop}) might be given the key
%\texttt{kiczales-1997-aop}.
%
%An example of a \BibTeX\ \file{.bib} file is included as
%\file{biblio.bib}.  A description of the format a \file{.bib}
%file is beyond the scope of this document.  We instead encourage
%you to use one of the several reference managers that support the
%\BibTeX\ format such as
%\webref{http://jabref.sourceforge.net}{JabRef} (multiple platforms) or
%\webref{http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net}{BibDesk} (MacOS\,X only). 
%These front ends are similar to reference managers such as
%EndNote or RefWorks.
%
%
%\subsection{Citing References}
%
%Having described some references, we then need to cite them.  We
%do this using a form of the \verb+\cite+ command.  For example:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \citet{kiczales-1997-aop} present examples of crosscutting 
%    from programs written in several languages.
%\end{lstlisting}
%When processed, the \verb+\citet+ will cause the paper's authors
%and a standardized reference to the paper to be inserted in the
%document, and will also include a formatted citation for the paper
%in the bibliography.  For example:
%\begin{quote}
%    \citet{kiczales-1997-aop} present examples of crosscutting 
%    from programs written in several languages.
%\end{quote}
%There are several forms of the \verb+\cite+ command (provided
%by the \latexpackage{natbib} package), as demonstrated in
%\autoref{tbl:natbib:cite}.
%Note that the form of the citation (numeric or author-year) depends
%on the bibliography style (described in the next section).
%The \verb+\citet+ variant is used when the author names form
%an object in the sentence, whereas the \verb+\citep+ variant
%is used for parenthetic references, more like an end-note.
%Use \verb+\nocite+ to include a citation in the bibliography
%but without an actual reference.
%\nocite{rowling-1997-hpps}
%\begin{table}
%\caption{Available \texttt{cite} variants; the exact citation style
%    depends on whether the bibliography style is numeric or author-year.}
%\label{tbl:natbib:cite}
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}{lp{3.25in}}\toprule
%Variant & Result \\
%\midrule
%% We cheat here to simulate the cite/citep/citet for APA-like styles
%\verb+\cite+ & Parenthetical citation (\eg ``\cite{kiczales-1997-aop}''
%    or ``(\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} \citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
%\verb+\citet+ & Textual citation: includes author (\eg
%    ``\citet{kiczales-1997-aop}'' or
%    or ``\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} (\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
%\verb+\citet*+ & Textual citation with unabbreviated author list \\
%\verb+\citealt+ & Like \verb+\citet+ but without parentheses \\
%\verb+\citep+ & Parenthetical citation (\eg ``\cite{kiczales-1997-aop}''
%    or ``(\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop} \citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop})'') \\
%\verb+\citep*+ & Parenthetical citation with unabbreviated author list \\
%\verb+\citealp+ & Like \verb+\citep+ but without parentheses \\
%\verb+\citeauthor+ & Author only (\eg ``\citeauthor{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
%\verb+\citeauthor*+ & Unabbreviated authors list 
%    (\eg ``\citeauthor*{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
%\verb+\citeyear+ & Year of citation (\eg ``\citeyear{kiczales-1997-aop}'') \\
%\bottomrule
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%\subsection{Formatting Cited References}
%
%\BibTeX\ separates the citing of a reference from how the cited
%reference is formatted for a bibliography, specified with the
%\verb+\bibliographystyle+ command. 
%There are many varieties, such as \texttt{plainnat}, \texttt{abbrvnat},
%\texttt{unsrtnat}, and \texttt{vancouver}.
%This document was formatted with \texttt{abbrvnat}.
%Look through your \TeX\ distribution for \file{.bst} files. 
%Note that use of some \file{.bst} files do not emit all the information
%necessary to properly use \verb+\citet{}+, \verb+\citep{}+,
%\verb+\citeyear{}+, and \verb+\citeauthor{}+.
%
%There are also packages available to place citations on a per-chapter
%basis (\latexpackage{bibunits}), as footnotes (\latexpackage{footbib}),
%and inline (\latexpackage{bibentry}).
%Those who wish to exert maximum control over their bibliography
%style should see the amazing \latexpackage{custom-bib} package.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Typesetting Tables}
%\label{sec:TypesettingTables}
%
%\citet{lamport-1994-ladps} made one grievous mistake
%in \LaTeX: his suggested manner for typesetting tables produces
%typographic abominations.  These suggestions have unfortunately
%been replicated in most \LaTeX\ tutorials.  These
%abominations are easily avoided simply by ignoring his examples
%illustrating the use of horizontal and vertical rules (specifically
%the use of \verb+\hline+ and \verb+|+) and using the
%\latexpackage{booktabs} package instead.
%
%The \latexpackage{booktabs} package helps produce tables in the form
%used by most professionally-edited journals through the use of
%three new types of dividing lines, or \emph{rules}.
%% There are times that you don't want to use \autoref{}
%Tables~\ref{tbl:natbib:cite} and~\ref{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols} are two
%examples of tables typeset with the \latexpackage{booktabs} package.
%The \latexpackage{booktabs} package provides three new commands
%for producing rules:
%\verb+\toprule+ for the rule to appear at the top of the table,
%\verb+\midrule+ for the middle rule following the table header,
%and \verb+\bottomrule+ for the bottom-most at the end of the table.
%These rules differ by their weight (thickness) and the spacing before
%and after.
%A table is typeset in the following manner:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \begin{table}
%    \caption{The caption for the table}
%    \label{tbl:label}
%    \centering
%    \begin{tabular}{cc}
%    \toprule
%    Header & Elements \\
%    \midrule
%    Row 1 & Row 1 \\
%    Row 2 & Row 2 \\
%    % ... and on and on ...
%    Row N & Row N \\
%    \bottomrule
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{table}
%\end{lstlisting}
%See the \latexpackage{booktabs} documentation for advice in dealing with
%special cases, such as subheading rules, introducing extra space
%for divisions, and interior rules.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Figures, Graphics, and Special Characters}
%\label{sec:Graphics}
%
%Most \LaTeX\ beginners find figures to be one of the more challenging
%topics.  In \LaTeX, a figure is a \emph{floating element}, to be
%placed where it best fits.
%The user is not expected to concern him/herself with the placement
%of the figure.  The figure should instead be labelled, and where
%the figure is used, the text should use \verb+\autoref+ to reference
%the figure's label.
%\autoref{fig:latex-affirmation} is an example of a figure.
%\begin{figure}
%    \centering
%    % For the sake of this example, we'll just use text
%    %\includegraphics[width=3in]{file}
%    \Huge{\textsf{\LaTeX\ Rocks!}}
%    \caption{Proof of \LaTeX's amazing abilities}
%    \label{fig:latex-affirmation}   % label should change
%\end{figure}
%A figure is generally included as follows:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \begin{figure}
%    \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=3in]{file}
%    \caption{A useful caption}
%    \label{fig:fig-label}   % label should change
%    \end{figure}
%\end{lstlisting}
%There are three items of note:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item External files are included using the \verb+\includegraphics+
%    command.  This command is defined by the \latexpackage{graphicx} package
%    and can often natively import graphics from a variety of formats.
%    The set of formats supported depends on your \TeX\ command processor.
%    Both \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{xelatex}, for example, can
%    import \textsc{gif}, \textsc{jpg}, and \textsc{pdf}.  The plain
%    version of \texttt{latex} only supports \textsc{eps} files.
%
%\item The \verb+\caption+ provides a caption to the figure. 
%    This caption is normally listed in the List of Figures; you
%    can provide an alternative caption for the LoF by providing
%    an optional argument to the \verb+\caption+ like so:
%    \begin{lstlisting}
%    \caption[nice shortened caption for LoF]{%

%\section{Special Characters and Symbols}
%\label{sec:SpecialSymbols}
%
%\LaTeX\ appropriates many common symbols for its own purposes,
%with some used for commands (\eg \verb+\{}&%+) and
%mathematics (\eg \verb+$^_+), and others are automagically transformed
%into typographically-preferred forms (\eg \verb+-`'+) or to
%completely different forms (\eg \verb+<>+).
%\autoref{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols} presents a list of common symbols and
%their corresponding \LaTeX\ commands.  A much more comprehensive list 
%of symbols and accented characters is available at:
%\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/}
%\begin{table}
%\caption{Useful \LaTeX\ symbols}\label{tbl:LaTeX:Symbols}

%\section{Changing Page Widths and Heights}
%
%The \class{ubcdiss} class is based on the standard \LaTeX\ \class{book}
%class~\cite{lamport-1994-ladps} that selects a line-width to carry
%approximately 66~characters per line.  This character density is
%claimed to have a pleasing appearance and also supports more rapid
%reading~\cite{bringhurst-2002-teots}.  I would recommend that you
%not change the line-widths!
%
%\subsection{The \texttt{geometry} Package}
%
%Some students are unfortunately saddled with misguided supervisors
%or committee members whom believe that documents should have the
%narrowest margins possible.  The \latexpackage{geometry} package is
%helpful in such cases.  Using this package is as simple as:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \usepackage[margin=1.25in,top=1.25in,bottom=1.25in]{geometry}
%\end{lstlisting}
%You should check the package's documentation for more complex uses.
%
%\subsection{Changing Page Layout Values By Hand}
%
%There are some miserable students with requirements for page layouts
%that vary throughout the document.  Unfortunately the
%\latexpackage{geometry} can only be specified once, in the document's
%preamble.  Such miserable students must set \LaTeX's layout parameters
%by hand:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    \setlength{\topmargin}{-.75in}
%    \setlength{\headsep}{0.25in}
%    \setlength{\headheight}{15pt}
%    \setlength{\textheight}{9in}
%    \setlength{\footskip}{0.25in}
%    \setlength{\footheight}{15pt}
%
%    % The *sidemargin values are relative to 1in; so the following
%    % results in a 0.75 inch margin
%    \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-0.25in}
%    \setlength{\evensidemargin}{-0.25in}
%    \setlength{\textwidth}{7in}       % 1.1in margins (8.5-2*0.75)
%\end{lstlisting}
%These settings necessarily require assuming a particular page height
%and width; in the above, the setting for \verb+\textwidth+ assumes
%a \textsc{US} Letter with an 8.5'' width.
%The \latexpackage{geometry} package simply uses the page height and
%other specified values to derive the other layout values.
%The
%\href{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/layout.pdf}{\texttt{layout}}
%package provides a
%handy \verb+\layout+ command to show the current page layout
%parameters. 
%
%
%\subsection{Making Temporary Changes to Page Layout}
%
%There are occasions where it becomes necessary to make temporary
%changes to the page width, such as to accomodate a larger formula. 
%The \latexmiscpackage{chngpage} package provides an \env{adjustwidth}
%environment that does just this.  For example:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%    % Expand left and right margins by 0.75in
%    \begin{adjustwidth}{-0.75in}{-0.75in}
%    % Must adjust the perceived column width for LaTeX to get with it.
%    \addtolength{\columnwidth}{1.5in}
%    \[ an extra long math formula \]
%    \end{adjustwidth}
%\end{lstlisting}

%\section{Keeping Track of Versions with Revision Control}
%\label{sec:DissertationRevisionControl}
%
%Software engineers have used \acf{RCS} to track changes to their
%software systems for decades.  These systems record the changes to
%the source code along with context as to why the change was required.
%These systems also support examining and reverting to particular
%revisions from their system's past.
%
%An \ac{RCS} can be used to keep track of changes to things other
%than source code, such as your dissertation.  For example, it can
%be useful to know exactly which revision of your dissertation was
%sent to a particular committee member.  Or to recover an accidentally
%deleted file, or a badly modified image.  With a revision control
%system, you can tag or annotate the revision of your dissertation
%that was sent to your committee, or when you incorporated changes
%from your supervisor.
%
%Unfortunately current revision control packages are not yet targetted
%to non-developers.  But the Subversion project's
%\webref{http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/}{TortoiseSVN}
%has greatly simplified using the Subversion revision control system
%for Windows users.  You should consult your local geek.
%
%A simpler alternative strategy is to create a GoogleMail account
%and periodically mail yourself zipped copies of your dissertation.
%

%\section{Recommended Packages}
%
%The real strength to \LaTeX\ is found in the myriad of free add-on
%packages available for handling special formatting requirements.
%In this section we list some helpful packages.
%
%\subsection{Typesetting}
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[\latexpackage{enumitem}:]
%    Supports pausing and resuming enumerate environments.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{ulem}:]
%    Provides two new commands for striking out and crossing out text
%    (\verb+\sout{text}+ and \verb+\xout{text}+ respectively)
%    The package should likely
%    be used as follows:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[normalem,normalbf]{ulem}
%    \end{verbatim}
%    to prevent the package from redefining the emphasis and bold fonts.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{chngpage}:]
%    Support changing the page widths on demand.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{mhchem}:] 
%    Support for typesetting chemical formulae and reaction equations.
%
%\end{description}
%
%Although not a package, the
%\webref{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/}{\texttt{latexdiff}}
%command is very useful for creating changebar'd versions of your
%dissertation.
%
%
%\subsection{Figures, Tables, and Document Extracts}
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[\latexpackage{pdfpages}:]
%    Insert pages from other PDF files.  Allows referencing the extracted
%    pages in the list of figures, adding labels to reference the page
%    from elsewhere, and add borders to the pages.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{subfig}:]
%    Provides for including subfigures within a figure, and includes
%    being able to separately reference the subfigures.  This is a
%    replacement for the older \texttt{subfigure} environment.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{rotating}:]
%    Provides two environments, sidewaystable and sidewaysfigure,
%    for typesetting tables and figures in landscape mode.  
%
%\item[\latexpackage{longtable}:]
%    Support for long tables that span multiple pages.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{tabularx}:]
%    Provides an enhanced tabular environment with auto-sizing columns.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{ragged2e}:]
%    Provides several new commands for setting ragged text (\eg forms
%    of centered or flushed text) that can be used in tabular
%    environments and that support hyphenation.
%
%\end{description}
%
%
%\subsection{Bibliography Related Packages}
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[\latexpackage{bibunits}:]
%    Support having per-chapter bibliographies.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{footbib}:]
%    Cause cited works to be rendered using footnotes.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{bibentry}:] 
%    Support placing the details of a cited work in-line.
%
%\item[\latexpackage{custom-bib}:]
%    Generate a custom style for your bibliography.
%
